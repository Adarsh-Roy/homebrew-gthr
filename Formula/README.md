# Gthr Homebrew Formula

This formula allows installation of gthr via Homebrew.

## Updating the formula

After each release:

1. Update the version number
2. Update the download URLs to match the new release tag
3. Update the SHA256 hashes for each platform

You can use the `update-formula.sh` script from the main repository to automate this process.
